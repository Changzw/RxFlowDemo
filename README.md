# RxFlowDemo
this is demo from https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxFlow

## Why is the repo possible?

Cause the demo of [RxFlow](https://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxFlow) can't work well, so I use Pod as the code manager to run it.

## How to use it?

```
git clone https://github.com/Changzw/RxFlowDemo.git
open Podfile. to change the versions you need.
pod update

finish
```
